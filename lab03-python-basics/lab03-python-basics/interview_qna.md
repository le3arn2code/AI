# Lab 03 Interview Q&A

### Q1: What are Python lists used for?
**A:** Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.

### Q2: How are tuples different from lists?
**A:** Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.

### Q3: Why use dictionaries?
**A:** Dictionaries allow storing key-value pairs for fast lookups.

### Q4: What is the advantage of using functions?
**A:** Functions allow code reusability and modular design.

### Q5: What is a for loop in Python?
**A:** A for loop iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.).

### Q6: How do you check if a number is even in Python?
**A:** Use `if number % 2 == 0:`.

### Q7: What happens if you try to modify a tuple?
**A:** Python raises a `TypeError` since tuples are immutable.

### Q8: Can a dictionary have duplicate keys?
**A:** No, dictionary keys must be unique.

### Q9: Why is indentation important in Python?
**A:** Indentation defines code blocks, replacing curly braces used in other languages.

### Q10: How can you iterate over dictionary keys?
**A:** Using `for key in dict.keys():`.
