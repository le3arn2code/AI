# Lab 17: Feature Selection & Importance

## Objectives
- Understand the concepts of feature selection and feature importance.
- Utilize Random Forest to rank features by importance.
- Remove features with low importance and compare performance.

## Files
- task1_feature_importance.py: Train Random Forest and plot feature importances.
- task2_remove_low_features.py: Remove low-importance features below a threshold.
- task3_compare_models.py: Compare accuracy with all vs reduced features.

## Instructions
1. Run `python3 task1_feature_importance.py` to see importance ranking.
2. Run `python3 task2_remove_low_features.py` to identify and remove weak features.
3. Run `python3 task3_compare_models.py` to compare model performance.
