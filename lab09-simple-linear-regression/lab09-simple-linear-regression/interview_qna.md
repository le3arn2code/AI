# Interview Q&A: Simple Linear Regression

1. **Q: What is simple linear regression?**
   - A: A statistical method to model the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.

2. **Q: What do slope and intercept represent?**
   - A: Slope indicates how much the dependent variable changes per unit change in the independent variable, while intercept is the predicted value when the independent variable is zero.

3. **Q: What assumptions does linear regression make?**
   - A: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normally distributed errors.

4. **Q: How do you evaluate a regression model?**
   - A: Using metrics like R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Q: What happens if your dataset has multicollinearity?**
   - A: In simple regression this doesn’t apply, but in multiple regression it inflates variance of coefficients.

6. **Q: Can linear regression handle categorical variables?**
   - A: Only after encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding).

7. **Q: How does outlier affect regression line?**
   - A: Outliers can skew slope and intercept significantly.

8. **Q: How do you visualize regression quality?**
   - A: By plotting regression line and residual plots.

9. **Q: What’s the difference between correlation and regression?**
   - A: Correlation measures relationship strength, regression predicts values.

10. **Q: In what cases is linear regression not suitable?**
   - A: Non-linear relationships, highly correlated errors, or when assumptions are violated.
