# Layman Explanation of Lab 19

This lab taught you how to **save and reuse a trained machine learning model**.

- **Task 1:** You trained a Random Forest model on the famous Iris flower dataset.  
- **Task 2:** You saved that trained model into a file on your computer using `joblib`.  
- **Task 3:** Instead of retraining, you loaded the saved model and used it to predict the flower type for some sample data.  

ðŸ’¡ In simple terms: You trained a model once, stored it, and reused it laterâ€”just like saving a game and loading it again instead of starting from the beginning!
