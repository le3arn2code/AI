# Lab 19: Simple Model Persistence (Save & Load)

## Objectives
- Understand the importance of model persistence.
- Learn how to use `joblib` to save and load models.
- Train a model, save it, and reload it for predictions.

## Instructions
1. Run `task1_train_model.py` to train a Random Forest model.
2. Run `task2_save_model.py` to save the trained model.
3. Run `task3_load_predict.py` to load the model and make predictions.

## Expected Outcome
- The trained model is saved as `random_forest_model.joblib`.
- Predictions can be made using the loaded model.
