# Lab 23: Early Stopping and Model Regularization

## Objectives
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Apply L2 regularization to simplify models.
- Compare validation loss with and without L2.

## Instructions
1. Run `task1_early_stopping.py` to train a model with early stopping.
2. Run `task2_l2_regularization.py` to train a model with L2 regularization.
3. Run `task3_compare_performance.py` to visualize validation loss comparison.
