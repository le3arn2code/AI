# Layman Explanation of Lab 23

In this lab, we trained a neural network and learned how to stop it from “overstudying.”

- **Early stopping**: Imagine you are practicing exam questions. If you keep practicing even after you're perfect, you might get tired and start making mistakes. Early stopping means stopping at the right time when you're good enough.

- **L2 regularization**: Think of it like adding a small penalty for making your notes too detailed. This way, you keep things simple and neat, which helps you remember better.

By the end, we saw that stopping at the right time and keeping the model simple helped it perform better on new unseen data.
