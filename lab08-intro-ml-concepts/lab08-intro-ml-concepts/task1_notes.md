# Task 1 – Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled datasets (features + target labels).
- Learns mapping from inputs → outputs.
- Example tasks:
  - Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
  - Regression (predicting house prices, stock forecasting)

## Unsupervised Learning
- Uses only input data (no labels).
- Finds patterns or structure in the data.
- Example tasks:
  - Clustering (customer segmentation)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, feature compression)

## Key Concepts
- **Labeled Data** → Required for supervised learning.
- **Cluster Analysis** → Key technique in unsupervised learning.
