# Interview Q&A â€“ Intro to Machine Learning (10 Questions)

**Q1:** What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?  
**A1:** Supervised uses labeled data, unsupervised uses unlabeled data to find patterns.

**Q2:** When would you use supervised learning?  
**A2:** When labeled data is available and the goal is prediction/classification.

**Q3:** When would you use unsupervised learning?  
**A3:** When only input data is available and the goal is pattern discovery or clustering.

**Q4:** Example of a supervised task in the real world?  
**A4:** Spam email detection (classification).

**Q5:** Example of an unsupervised task in the real world?  
**A5:** Customer segmentation in marketing (clustering).

**Q6:** What is overfitting in supervised learning?  
**A6:** When the model learns noise in training data, performing poorly on new data.

**Q7:** What is k-NN used for?  
**A7:** A supervised algorithm for classification/regression based on nearest neighbors.

**Q8:** What is k-Means used for?  
**A8:** An unsupervised algorithm for clustering data into k groups.

**Q9:** Why use dimensionality reduction techniques?  
**A9:** To reduce features while preserving important information, improving speed and performance.

**Q10:** What role does labeled data play in supervised learning?  
**A10:** It guides the model during training by showing the correct answers.
