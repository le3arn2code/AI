# Lab 08 â€“ Intro to Machine Learning Concepts

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamental machine learning concepts.
- Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Identify appropriate tasks for each type of learning.
- Learn when to implement each approach in practical scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Tasks
1. **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning (Theory)**  
   Notes on differences, examples, and key concepts.

2. **Examples with Code**  
   - Supervised: k-NN classification on Iris dataset.  
   - Unsupervised: k-Means clustering on synthetic data.  

3. **Short Note**  
   When to use supervised vs unsupervised approaches.

## Run Instructions
```bash
python3 task2_examples.py
```
- Accuracy for supervised learning will print in the terminal.  
- Unsupervised learning will save `kmeans_clusters.png`.

## Expected Outputs
- Notes and short notes in markdown files.  
- Accuracy score (classification).  
- `kmeans_clusters.png` showing clusters and centroids.
