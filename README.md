```

Each lab folder generally includes:
- `README.md` â€” objectives, steps, summary  
- `commands.sh` â€” terminal commands used  
- `troubleshooting.md` â€” errors encountered & fixes  
- `interview_qna.md` â€” Q&A for interviews  
- Python or notebook scripts  
- `screenshots/` folder

## ðŸš€ How to Use It

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/le3arn2code/AI.git
cd AI
```

### 2. Setup Python Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
```

### 3. Install Common Dependencies
If there is a `requirements.txt` in the root, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Otherwise, each lab contains its own `requirements.txt` or `commands.sh`.

### 4. Run a Lab
Navigate into the lab folder, e.g. `lab40-final-project`, then:
```bash
bash commands.sh   # or `python3 lab40_final_project.py`
```

## ðŸ›  Why This Format Works

- **Modular & Scalable**: Each lab is independent and self-contained  
- **Learner focused**: Step-by-step progression from basics to project  
- **Interview prep**: Q&A files help internalize concepts  
- **Error logs**: `troubleshooting.md` captures real pitfalls and fixes  
- **Verification**: Screenshots confirm that the code runs  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices & Tips

- Always commit code **before** making major changes  
- Use Git tags (e.g. `lab40`) to mark stable states  
- Keep `README.md` inside each lab updated with results  
- For long-running labs (DL, training), use checkpoints & logging  
- Try variations: different models, more features, hyperparameter tuning  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress, Metrics & Goals

- Lab completion is tracked by pushing each lab folder  
- Use and compare your results over time  
- Revisit earlier labs and re-run with updated techniques  
- Extend Capstone (Lab 40) by deploying a REST API, adding UI, etc.
