# Lab 24: Interview Q&A

1. **What is a CNN?**
   - A deep learning model specialized for images using convolution layers.

2. **Why use convolutional layers?**
   - To automatically extract spatial features from images.

3. **What is pooling?**
   - Downsampling to reduce dimensions and retain key info.

4. **Why normalize input images?**
   - Ensures stable and faster training.

5. **Why reshape images to (28,28,1)?**
   - CNN expects a channel dimension.

6. **Why use ReLU in CNN?**
   - Prevents vanishing gradients and speeds convergence.

7. **Why use softmax in output?**
   - Provides class probabilities for classification.

8. **Why MNIST dataset?**
   - It's a simple, widely used benchmark for image classification.

9. **What is the role of fully connected layers?**
   - To map extracted features into class predictions.

10. **How to improve CNN performance?**
   - Use more layers, dropout, batch normalization, or more epochs.
