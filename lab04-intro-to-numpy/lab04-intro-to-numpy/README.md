# Lab 4: Introduction to NumPy

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamental features and benefits of using NumPy.
- Learn how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays.
- Perform basic indexing and slicing on arrays.
- Utilize built-in NumPy functions for common operations.

## Tasks
1. **Import NumPy and Create Arrays**
   - Create 1D and 2D arrays with `np.array()`.

2. **Perform Basic Indexing and Slicing**
   - Access elements with indices.
   - Slice subarrays.

3. **Use Built-in NumPy Functions**
   - Reshape arrays with `reshape()`.
   - Find mean with `np.mean()`.
   - Sum elements with `np.sum()`.

## Conclusion
This lab introduced the basics of NumPy: arrays, indexing, slicing, and core mathematical operations.
