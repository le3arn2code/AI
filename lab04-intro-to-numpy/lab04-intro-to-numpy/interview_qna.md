# Interview Q&A - Lab 4: Introduction to NumPy

**Q1. What is NumPy and why is it used?**
A: NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing. It provides arrays, matrices, and fast mathematical operations.

**Q2. How does a NumPy array differ from a Python list?**
A: NumPy arrays are homogeneous, support vectorized operations, and are faster in performance than lists.

**Q3. How do you create a NumPy array?**
A: Using `np.array([1,2,3])`.

**Q4. How do you access elements in a NumPy array?**
A: Using zero-based indexing like `arr[0]`.

**Q5. What is slicing in NumPy?**
A: Extracting a portion of an array, e.g., `arr[0:2]`.

**Q6. How do you reshape an array in NumPy?**
A: With `arr.reshape(rows, cols)`.

**Q7. How do you calculate the mean of an array?**
A: Using `np.mean(arr)`.

**Q8. How do you calculate the sum of elements in an array?**
A: Using `np.sum(arr)`.

**Q9. What is broadcasting in NumPy?**
A: A feature that allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes.

**Q10. Why is NumPy important in AI/ML?**
A: It provides the foundation for scientific libraries like Pandas, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
