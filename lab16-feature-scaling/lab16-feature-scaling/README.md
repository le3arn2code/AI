# Lab 16: Feature Scaling (Standardization)

## Objectives
- Understand the concept and importance of feature scaling in machine learning.
- Learn how to use `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn for standardization.
- Practice standardizing numeric features in a dataset.
- Compare model outcomes before and after applying feature scaling.

## Lab Tasks
1. **Import StandardScaler from scikit-learn** (task1_import_scaler.py)
2. **Standardize Numeric Features** (task2_standardize_features.py)
3. **Compare Models with/without Scaling** (task3_compare_models.py)

## How to Run
```bash
python3 task1_import_scaler.py
python3 task2_standardize_features.py
python3 task3_compare_models.py
```

Expected outputs include confirmation of imports, original vs. scaled dataset samples, and accuracy comparison with/without scaling.
