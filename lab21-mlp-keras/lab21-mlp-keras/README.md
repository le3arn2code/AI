# Lab 21: Basic MLP with Keras/TensorFlow

## Objectives
- Build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
- Train the model on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluate model performance and understand accuracy metrics.

## Files
- `task1_build_model.py`: Defines and summarizes the MLP architecture.
- `task2_train_model.py`: Trains the model on MNIST and saves it.
- `task3_evaluate_model.py`: Loads the model and evaluates accuracy on test data.
- `troubleshooting.md`: Common issues and fixes.
- `interview_qna.md`: 10 real-world Q&A on MLPs and neural networks.
- `layman_explanation.md`: Simple explanation of what this lab does.
- `screenshot.png`: Training and evaluation screenshot.

## Instructions
1. Run `python3 task1_build_model.py` to view the model summary.
2. Run `python3 task2_train_model.py` to train and save the model.
3. Run `python3 task3_evaluate_model.py` to evaluate accuracy.
