# Interview Q&A

1. What is an MLP?
- A type of neural network with fully connected layers.

2. Why use activation functions like ReLU?
- To introduce non-linearity.

3. Why normalize MNIST images?
- To improve training stability and convergence.

4. What does `Flatten` do in Keras?
- Converts 2D image arrays into 1D feature vectors.

5. Why use `softmax` in the output layer?
- For multi-class classification.

6. How is accuracy calculated?
- Ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.

7. Why use Adam optimizer?
- Adaptive learning rates for efficient training.

8. What is an epoch?
- One full pass through the dataset.

9. What are train/test splits?
- Separation to evaluate generalization on unseen data.

10. Why save models?
- To reuse them later without retraining.
