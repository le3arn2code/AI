# Layman Explanation

This lab shows how to build a **basic artificial brain** (neural network) that learns to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9).

- First, we **define the brain's structure** (layers of "neurons").
- Then, we **train it with lots of examples** of digits.
- Finally, we **test it** to see how well it learned.

Think of it like teaching a child: show them thousands of pictures of numbers, and eventually they learn to recognize them. Here, the computer is the "child," and MNIST digits are the "pictures."
