# Lab 15: Overfitting vs. Underfitting

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of overfitting and underfitting in ML models.
- Train a model on a small dataset and observe training vs validation scores.
- Explore techniques to adjust model complexity.
- Analyze how changing model parameters affects performance.

## Files
- `task1_train_validate.py`: Train a Decision Tree and compare training vs validation scores.
- `task2_adjust_depth.py`: Train Decision Trees with different depths and save performance plot.
- `troubleshooting.md`: Common issues and fixes.
- `interview_qna.md`: 10 real-life interview Q&As on overfitting vs underfitting.
- `screenshot.png`: Placeholder for screenshots of outputs.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 task1_train_validate.py
python3 task2_adjust_depth.py
```
The second script saves a plot as `depth_vs_performance.png`.
