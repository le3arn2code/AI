# Lab 10: Simple Logistic Regression

## Objectives
- Understand logistic regression for binary classification.
- Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
- Evaluate accuracy and interpret coefficients.

## Tasks
1. Load dataset and visualize study hours vs pass/fail outcomes.
2. Train logistic regression model.
3. Evaluate predictions, accuracy, confusion matrix, coefficients, and plot decision boundary.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 task1_load_dataset.py
python3 task2_train_model.py
python3 task3_evaluate_model.py
```
