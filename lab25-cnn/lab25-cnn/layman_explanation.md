# Layman Explanation of Lab 25

This lab is like teaching a computer to recognize handwritten numbers.

- First, we showed it how to look at small parts of the picture (convolution).
- Then, we asked it to shrink the image a bit to keep the important details (pooling).
- Finally, it made a guess about which number it saw (dense layer).

By the end, the computer got really good at telling which number was written, almost 98% correct!
