# Lab 25: Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks

## Objectives
- Understand CNN architecture and working
- Implement a simple CNN using Keras
- Train and evaluate on MNIST

## Instructions
1. Run `task1_build_cnn.py` to build and summarize the model.
2. Run `task2_train_cnn.py` to train and save the CNN model.
3. Run `task3_evaluate_cnn.py` to evaluate the trained model on test data.

Ensure you have installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
```
