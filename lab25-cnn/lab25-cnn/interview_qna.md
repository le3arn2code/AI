# Lab 25 Interview Q&A

1. **What is a CNN?**
   - A specialized deep learning model for processing grid-like data such as images.

2. **Why use convolutional layers?**
   - To automatically extract spatial features from images.

3. **What role does pooling play?**
   - It reduces dimensionality and computation while preserving features.

4. **Why normalize input data?**
   - Ensures faster convergence and stability.

5. **What does Flatten() do in CNNs?**
   - Converts 2D feature maps into 1D vectors for Dense layers.

6. **Why use ReLU in CNNs?**
   - It introduces non-linearity and avoids vanishing gradient issues.

7. **What is overfitting in CNNs?**
   - When the model memorizes training data instead of generalizing.

8. **How can you prevent overfitting in CNNs?**
   - Data augmentation, dropout, regularization, early stopping.

9. **What datasets are commonly used for CNN benchmarking?**
   - MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet.

10. **Why is CNN better for image tasks compared to MLP?**
    - CNN leverages local spatial structure and parameter sharing, making it more efficient.
