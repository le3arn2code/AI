# Lab 14: Train-Test Split & Cross-Validation

## Objectives
- Understand the importance of data splitting in model evaluation.
- Learn how to use the `train_test_split` method for creating training and testing datasets.
- Implement k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance.
- Compare the effectiveness of train-test split versus cross-validation.

## Files
- `task1_train_test_split.py`: Demonstrates how to load the Iris dataset and split it into train/test sets.
- `task2_cross_validation.py`: Implements k-fold cross-validation using Logistic Regression.
- `task3_compare.py`: Compares train-test split results with cross-validation results.
- `troubleshooting.md`: Common issues and fixes.
- `interview_qna.md`: 10 real-life interview Q&A related to splitting and validation.
- `screenshot.png`: Placeholder for output screenshots.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 task1_train_test_split.py
