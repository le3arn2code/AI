# Lab 26 Explained in Simple Terms

Think of transfer learning like this:  
Imagine you already know how to ride a **bike**. Learning to ride a **motorbike** will be faster because the balance skills transfer over.

Here, VGG16 is the "bike" â€” it already knows how to recognize shapes, edges, colors from millions of images.  
We just add a few custom layers (like motorbike controls) to adapt it for **cats vs. dogs** classification.

This way, instead of training from scratch (which takes huge time and data), we **reuse knowledge** and train much faster with fewer images.
