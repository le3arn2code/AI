# Lab 36: Basic Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This lab demonstrates the basics of time series forecasting using a synthetic dataset of daily temperatures. 
We implement two forecasting approaches:
1. **ARIMA Model** (from statsmodels)
2. **Linear Regression Model** (from scikit-learn)

We compare the model performances using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and visualization.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of Time Series Forecasting.
- Learn how to split a time series dataset into training and testing data.
- Fit a basic ARIMA or Linear Regression model for forecasting.
- Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics.

## Results
- **ARIMA Model** captured seasonal patterns better but lagged behind actual data.
- **Linear Regression** gave a simple trend line but was less accurate.
- **MSE values** showed ARIMA performed better for this dataset.

This lab provides hands-on practice for real-world forecasting tasks.
