# Lab 11: K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

## Objectives
- Understand fundamentals of KNN classification.
- Implement KNN using scikit-learn.
- Experiment with different k values and compare accuracy.
- Analyze the effect of k on model performance.

## Tasks
1. **Load and Split Dataset**
   - Load Iris dataset and split into train/test sets.
2. **Train KNN Model**
   - Train KNN classifier with k=3.
3. **Test Different k Values**
   - Evaluate accuracy for k=1 to 15 and plot results.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 task1_load_split.py
python3 task2_train_knn.py
python3 task3_test_k.py
```
