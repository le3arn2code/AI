# Lab 20: Intro to Neural Networks (Concept)

## Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts of neural networks, including neurons, activation functions, and layers.
- Learn how to draw a simple neural network diagram.
- Summarize key terminology related to neural networks.

## Instructions
1. Run `task1_activation_functions.py` to test Sigmoid and ReLU outputs.
2. Run `task2_draw_network.py` to generate and save a neural network diagram (`neural_network_diagram.png`).
3. Read `task3_summary.md` for a summary of key concepts.
