### Key Terms

**Neuron**: A mathematical unit that combines inputs with weights and passes them through an activation function.

**Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions like Sigmoid or ReLU that help networks learn complex patterns.

**Layers**: Groups of neurons arranged sequentially â€” Input Layer (raw data), Hidden Layers (learning), Output Layer (prediction).
