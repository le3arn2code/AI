# Lab 40: Final Mini AI Project - California Housing Prices

This lab demonstrates a complete ML pipeline on the California Housing dataset from Kaggle.

## Steps Covered
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Feature Engineering (scaling)
4. Train/Test Split
5. Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)
6. Model Evaluation (RMSE)

## Dataset
