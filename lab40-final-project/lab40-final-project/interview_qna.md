# Lab 40 Interview Q&A

**Q1: What problem does this project solve?**  
A: Predicts California housing prices using ML.

**Q2: Why Random Forest Regressor?**  
A: Robust, handles non-linearities and categorical variables well, less tuning needed.

**Q3: What does RMSE mean?**  
A: Root Mean Squared Error indicates average prediction error magnitude.

**Q4: How could the model be improved?**  
A: Add more features, try XGBoost/LightGBM, hyperparameter tuning.

**Q5: Why scale features?**  
A: Ensures fair treatment of different ranges, improves model performance.
